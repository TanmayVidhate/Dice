# Dice Roller

A simple dice roller web application built using ```HTML```, ```CSS```, and ```JavaScript```.

This mini project is a **dice roller** application that simulates rolling a dice. It can be used to roll a dice virtually, making it useful for games and other activities that require random ***number generation***.
